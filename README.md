# tibetan-transliterator

A naive attempt at automatically generating reliable tibetan transliterations
based on customizable sets of rules.

Getting started
-----------

Just copy the repository locally.

Usage
-----------

### As a library

```js
new TibetanTransliterator('མཁྱེན').transliterate()
=> 'khyen'
```

### As a tool

#### `index.html`

![Demo](./docs/index-small.jpg)

* Choose your prefered transliteration style at the top
* Paste your tibetan in the left box
* Click *Copy to clipboard* at the top of the right box to copy the
  transliteration

#### `compare.html`

![Demo](./docs/compare-small.jpg)

* Choose your prefered transliteration style at the top
* Paste your tibetan in the left box
* Paste your existing transliteration in the middle box
* See the differences in the right box
* Clicking on a difference will make the necessary change in the existing
  transliteration so that it will disappear from the right box, allowing you
  to quickly prune those that are irrelevant to you.

Testing
-----------

![Demo](./docs/tests-small.jpg)

Just open `tests.html`.

Categories can be clicked to reveal their test cases.

To ease debugging, clicking a tibetan case on the right side will re-run the
test for just that particular case.

TODO
-----------

See `TODO.md`

Credits

The rules used to deconstruct the syllables into parts (root, prefix, ...)
are almost entirely based on John Rockwell's ZALKEJZAMLEKJZA

# TODO

## Features
* Add tests for the rest of prefixes
* Add tests for suffixes

## Questions to knowledgeable people
* What's the rule with ཤ and ཞ? (Sha/zha? Both sha? Then how do we differentiate?)
* Are there rules for mute suffixes? (i.e. བད**ག**)
  * For now ག at the end is always present
* Are there rules for links between syllables? (i.e. ཡ་**མ**ཚན)
  * It seems there aren't any hard rules (i.e. John Rockwell's)
    so we handle every case as an exception
* Is there a logic behind the accent on é? (i.e. Yamts**e**n choki ngötrup ny**é**)

## Special cases
* འཕགས་མཆོག་ == pachok? p'achok? p'akchok?

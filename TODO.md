# TODO

## Features
* Use diff.js
* Add tests for the rest of prefixes
* Add tests for suffixes
* Handle འི
* Try to find exceptions for the remaining of the syllables,
  then one less, then on less, then only transliterate.
  That should get rid of searching for exceptions at different levels


## Questions to knowledgeable people
* What's the rule with ཤ and ཞ? (Sha/zha? Both sha? Then how do we differentiate?)
* Are there rules for mute suffixes? (i.e. བད**ག**)
* Are there rules for links between syllables? (i.e. ཡ་**མ**ཚན)
* Is there a logic behind the accent on é? (i.e. Yamts**e**n choki ngötrup ny**é**)

## Special cases
* འཕགས་མཆོག་ == pachok? p'achok? p'akchok?

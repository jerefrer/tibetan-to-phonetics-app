<h1 id="tibetan-transliterator">tibetan-transliterator</h1>
<p>A naive attempt at automatically generating reliable tibetan transliterations
based on customizable sets of rules.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Just copy the repository locally.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p><img src="./docs/index-small.jpg" alt="Demo"></p>
<h3 id="indexhtml"><code>index.html</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose your prefered transliteration style at the top</li>
<li>Paste your tibetan in the left box</li>
<li>Click <em>Copy to clipboard</em> on the right box to copy the transliteration</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./docs/compare-small.jpg" alt="Demo"></p>
<h3 id="comparehtml"><code>compare.html</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose your prefered transliteration style at the top</li>
<li>Paste your tibetan in the left box</li>
<li>Paste your existing transliteration in the middle box</li>
<li>See the differences in the right box</li>
<li>Clicking on a difference will make the necessary change in the existing
transliteration so that it will disappear from the right box, allowing you
to quickly prune those that are irrelevant to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just open <code>tests.html</code></li>
<li>To ease debugging, clicking a tibetan case on the right side will re-run
the test for just that particular case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>The rules used to deconstruct the syllables into parts (root, prefix, ...)
are almost entirely based on John Rockwell&#39;s ZALKEJZAMLEKJZA</p>
